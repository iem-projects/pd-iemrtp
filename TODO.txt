TODO for the RTP-bindings
=========================


RTCP support
------------
currently we have only implemented the streaming (RTP) part of the protocol.
but we really should also do the RTCP part

depayloader
-----------
provide the decoded signals in a user-friendly way, e.g. using send~

L16 payloading
--------------
there is a lot of noise in the L16 payload
(check whether it's the encoder or the decoder)
